    <h1>The brief history of Japan</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Ancient Japan</h2>
    <p>Early Japanese history is traditionally divided into five major eras:<br>the Paleolithic (c. 50,000 BC – c. 12,000BC), Jomon (c. 11,000 BC to 300 BC),<br>Yayoi (9,000 BC – 250 AD), Kofun (300 AD – 552 AD) and Yamato Periods (552-710 AD).<br>
        Before Nihon came into official use, Japan was known as Wa (倭) or Wakoku (倭国). Wa was a name early China<br>used to refer to an ethnic group living in Japan around the time of the Three Kingdoms Period. The Yayoi people primarily<br>lived on the island of Kyushu to the Kanto region on Honshu.</p>
    <h2>Classical Japan</h2>
    <p>The Heian period (794–1185) is a critical period of Japanese history. Although the cultural<br>heritage imparted by China and the early Korean states remains a part of Japan, distinct<br>and sophisticated Japanese cultural forms emerged during this period.</p>
    <h2>Fuedal Japan</h2>
    <p><dfn>Fuedal</dfn> Japan lasted from the years 1185 AD to 1603 AD. During this period in Japan's history,<br>the shoguns held more power in society than the emperor and the imperial court.</p>
    <h2>Early Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>Early modern Japan, or the period between 1600 and 1868, witnessed the birth of<br>many of Japan's most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as the expansion of its basic <em>geographic</em> boundaries.</p>
    <h2>Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>The <samp>modern</samp> state of Japan came into being on Oct. 23, 1868, when the Edo era ended and<br>the Meiji emperor ascended to the throne.</p>
